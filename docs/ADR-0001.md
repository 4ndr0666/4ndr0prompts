# ADR-0001: Plugin-based architecture

This project separates the user interface from data loading and
prompt generation.

* Shell scripts call Python modules to load `dataset/templates.json`.
* Optional plugins inside `plugins/` supply additional slot values.
* The CLI copies results to the clipboard when `xclip` is available.

Future work may include plugin discovery via entry points and schema
validation for custom datasets.
