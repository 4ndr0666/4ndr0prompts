## 1 · Executive Summary
This document converts the high‑level “**build a prompt → copy it → feed it to Hailuo/Sora**” objective into a **fully‑actionable, audit‑grade ticket map**.  
It is intended as the living backbone for project management, CI/CD orchestration, and compliance auditing. All tickets are categorised by functional stream, cross‑referenced, and supplied with unambiguous acceptance criteria.  
The minimal stack is deliberately constrained to **POSIX‑sh + `fzf` + Python (≤ 120 LoC)**. Anything beyond that must justify its complexity against the project’s _radical simplicity_ rubric.

---

## 2 · Project Objective
```text
Deliver a reproducible, single‑binary‑friendly CLI that:
  1. Lets a user pick a template + slot dictionary via fzf.
  2. Generates the merged prompt with a skinny Python helper.
  3. Copies the final prompt to the system clipboard (or stdout fallback).
  4. Is fully test‑covered, shell‑checked, CI‑gated, and documented.
```

## 3 · Organisational Roles & Work‑Streams

| Abbrev | Work‑Stream / Role | Core Responsibilities |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **ARC** | **Architecture & Governance** | Owns the north‑star design, reviews deviation requests. |
| **SHE** | **Shell Engineering** | Writes POSIX‑sh scripts, enforces `set -euo pipefail`, ShellCheck gate. |
| **PYL** | **Python Library Eng.** | Maintains `promptgen.py`, YAML parsers, unit tests. |
| **CI**  | **CI/CD & Automation** | GitHub Actions, pre‑commit, release workflows, SemVer tagging. |
| **QA**  | **Quality & Security** | Static analysis, code‑owner reviews, SBOM, supply‑chain audit. |
| **DOC** | **Documentation** | README, man‑pages, ADRs, this AGENTS.md upkeep. |

> **Note:** Roles can be shared in smaller teams, but tickets retain their stream prefixes for audit clarity.

## 5 · Detailed Ticket Descriptions

### 10‑001  SHE  “Repo dedup & hygiene”
**Goal:** Delete redundant copies of `CHANGELOG.md`, `prompts.sh`, `codex‑generate.sh` and any *.bak* files.  
**Steps**
1. `git ls-files | sort | uniq -d` → identify dups.  
2. Remove unnecessary copies; keep canonical under project root.  
3. Amend `.gitignore` for editor/temp files.  
**Acceptance**  
* `git ls-files | sort | uniq -d` returns _no_ duplicates.  
* `shellcheck` passes on remaining `.sh` files.  

---

### 10‑002  SHE  “`choose_prompt.sh` picker”
**Scope:** Pure POSIX‑sh, ≤ 100 LoC.  
```bash
fzf --prompt='Category > ' --height=40% --border
```
**Acceptance**  
* Picks valid template & slot file.  
* Exits non‑zero on cancel.  
* Passes bats tests: `test/picker.bats`.  

<!-- Additional ticket details would follow the same pattern for brevity here... -->

## 6 · Milestones & Road‑map

| Sprint | Targets | Blocking Tickets |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **Sprint 1** (Week 1) | Core picker + generator, CI gates | 10‑001 → 10‑006 |
| **Sprint 2** (Week 2) | Docs, SBOM, first tagged release v0.1.0 | 20‑001, 10‑007 |
| **Sprint 3** (Week 3‑4) | Cross‑platform clipboard, plugin ADR | 30‑001, 30‑003 |
| **Sprint 4+** | Enhancements (schema, web shim) | 30‑002, 40‑001 |

---

## 7 · Automation & Infrastructure

* **GitHub Actions**
  * `ci.yml` – lint, test, SBOM, produce artefacts.
  * `release.yml` – semver tag trigger → build tarball, publish GH Release.
* **Pre‑commit** hooks
  * `shellcheck`, `shfmt`, `ruff`, `black`, `pytest -q`.
* **Container Image**
  * Alpine‑based `Dockerfile` holding _only_ `fzf`,`bash`,`python3`,`pyyaml`.
  * Published via GHCR on every release.
* **SBOM**
  * `CycloneDX` JSON produced and attached to release assets.
* **Secrets**
  * No secrets needed; clipboard handled locally. GitHub PAT only for releases.

---

## 8 · Coding Standards & Audit Rules

1. **Shell**  
   * Mandatory shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.  
   * `set -euo pipefail` and `IFS=$'\n\t'` at top of every script.  
   * Guard unbound vars: `: "{{'${'}VAR:-}}"` (escaped braces for docs).  
2. **Python**  
   * `ruff` zero warnings.  
   * Typing: `mypy --strict` passes for `promptgen.py`.  
3. **Licensing**  
   * All new files include SPDX header `SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`.  
4. **Commits**  
   * Conventional Commits spec (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.).  
   * Signed‑off‑by line (`git commit -s`).  

---

## 9 · Further Enhancements (post‑MVP)

| Idea | Rationale | LoE | Notes |
|------|-----------|-----|-------|
| _fzf‑preview markdown_ | Render template diff in right pane | M | Use `bat --color` |
| _Template versioning_ | Rollback prompts via Git tags | L | Hooks in `promptgen.py` |
| _GUI fallback_ | Serve Textual UI on `--serve` | M | Optional dep, behind flag |
| _Plugin marketplace_ | Downloadable prompt packs | L | Needs ADR‑0002 |

---

## 10 · Approval Rubric (go/no‑go)

| Category | Passing Threshold | Audit Method |
|----------|------------------|--------------|
| **Unit & Bats tests** | ≥ 95 % statements | `pytest --cov`, `bats --timing` |
| **Static lint** | 0 errors, ≤ 5 warn | CI step `lint` |
| **CI status** | All green | GH Checks |
| **SBOM** | Present & signed | `cosign verify‑attestation` |
| **Doc coverage** | README + man‑page + ADR #1 | Doc review |
| **Artefact size** | Tarball <1 MiB | CI step `size‑watch` |
| **Performance** | Picker cold‑start <50 ms | `hyperfine` benchmark |

Any failure blocks merge to `main`.

---

## 11 · Contribution Guide (condensed)

1. Fork, branch off `main`.
2. Run `make setup` (installs hooks).
3. Commit, run `make pre‑push`.
4. Open PR; assign reviewers by stream tag.
5. Address review; squash‑merge with Conventional Commit header.

---

## 12 · Glossary

* **Template**: YAML text with `{{slot}}` placeholders.  
* **Slot file**: YAML mapping for placeholders.  
* **ADR**: Architecture Decision Record.
